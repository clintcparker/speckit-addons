## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-30

First published release. `send-it` 0.1.0 with two steps inserted before `ship`.

### Added

- Seven `command` steps: `specify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `implement` →
  `review` → `qa` → `ship`.
- `review` step (`speckit.staff-review.run` from the
  [`staff-review`](https://github.com/arunt14/spec-kit-staff-review) extension)
  with one fix-and-re-run pass on a CHANGES REQUIRED verdict.
- `qa` step (`speckit.qa.run` from the
  [`qa`](https://github.com/arunt14/spec-kit-qa) extension) with one
  fix-and-re-run pass on a FAILURES FOUND verdict, preferring CLI QA mode.
- `ship` step `args` instructing it to proceed past surviving review/QA
  findings and summarize them under "Known issues" in the pull request.

[0.1.0]: https://github.com/clintcparker/speckit-addons/releases/tag/send-it-checked-v0.1.0
